We are pleased to announce the 2020 Atlanta Symposium on Political Science (ASOPS), hosted by the Political Science Department at Georgia State University on March 7, 2020.  ASOPS is an opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students to present on-going research – at various stages – in a low-pressure environment.  Participants will have the opportunity to hear research from their peers, receive feedback from Georgia State faculty, and network with other students and faculty in their areas of interest.
